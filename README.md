# CLIPPIE CHROME EXTENSION

**Clippie** is designed for users who have to copy and paste from templates everyday. Define some clips in the app, and they'll always be there to be copied later.

You can download the **Clippie** Chrome extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clippiez/ialmfmcldokjkefelioamloepafmelon). There's also a dedicated desktop app for Mac (Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows and Linux (64 bit versions only) from [here](https://github.com/YuhApps/Clippiez-Desktop). Note that the desktop app and crx don't share data. You'll need to export and import JSON clips on your own to share the data between the two.
